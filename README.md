# hello-world
My first repository

Hi! NYC based music teacher/freelance chorister gone ROGUE -- trying her hand at tech stuff. 
Here on GitHub to start building my personal website and understand what the heck all my friends who use GitHub at work are talking about. 
Feel like I'm shouting into the void here -- (can I use an em dash in GitHub?) going to do my first COMMIT CHANGE or whatever
